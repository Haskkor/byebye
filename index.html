    <p>
      Let's start with a few photos. I went through 4 years of camera roll to find them. I may have cried a little. I
      may have cried a lot. Who knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of you will not know most of the people in most of the photos (most). That's how fast things move at Jarden.

    <p>
      Best time with the best people.
